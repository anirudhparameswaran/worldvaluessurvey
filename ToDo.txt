Overall idea:
1. We need to consider full dataset - so simply need to skip the sampling sets
2. We were recommended to not use multi-level models for only 2 groups and use interaction models. Read more: https://statisticsbyjim.com/regression/interaction-effects/

For point number 1:
In the analysis_resample.ipynb, the filtered_dataset variable has the complete dataset. Just check if each variable is encoded correctly and overall data sanity and simply use in the t code

For point number 2:
Use bayes_sampled.R file
Make an interaction model with some or all the variables.
Here, you have to ideally run the same models once for India and once for USA because it would be wrong to assume they have the same distributions  
Take the following steps:
- formula definition
- check summary or other stats (look at other functions used in the code)
- plot whatever necessary (we can plot it again once the model is saved)
- save model using saveRDS() function
